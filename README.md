## Abstract

A decade ago, psychologist Jerome Kagan argued that three incompatible research cultures exist in academia: the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities (Kagan, 2009). From its inception, GIScience has been porous, inter-disciplinary and multi-paradigm, mingling with other communities (Blaschke & Merschdorf, 2014). However, most research in GIScience comfortably situates itself with the natural and quantitative social sciences. Interactions with the more qualitative social sciences are limited, and often tense, as the critical GIS debates demonstrate (Sui & DeLyser, 2012). Substantive GIScience work in the humanities is limited to historical GIS (Roberts et al., 2014).

This workshop aims to provide the opportunity to explore, showcase and engage with research practices and projects that link GIScience to the social sciences and the humanities. The discussion will be articulated along three core concerns. (1) In what ways are GIScientists working across qualitative and quantitative realms with social scientists, and humanists? What are the scientific, epistemic, ethical, and practical implications of these interactions? Is GIScience a meta-science that can reduce friction between different disciplines? (2) How can GIScientists engage more effectively with interdisciplinary teams that involve social scientists and humanists? What are promising strategies to conduct not only "respectable", but high-impact GIScience research in the context of those collaborations? (3) How should GIScience position itself in the broader academic landscape with respect to non-STEM disciplines, not just in scientific terms, but also regarding funding and publication strategy?

We encourage submissions from researchers who engage with or have an interest in disciplines such as human geography, history, economics, linguistics, archeology, public health, sociology, media studies, and political science. More specifically, the topics include (but are not limited to):

- GIScience for social sciences
- Spatial digital humanities
- Spatial social media and social research
- Information geography and digital geography
- Spatial media studies, cultural analytics 
- Information studies, science & technology studies
- Qualitative GIS and critical GIS
